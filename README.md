Edu Mate is a simple and interactive EdTech platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to help students prepare for exams like JEE, NEET, CUET, NDA, and UCEED. The website guides users through a smooth flow starting from login to selecting their exam, difficulty level, subject, and chapter. Each chapter page shows a reference YouTube video along with practice questions on the same screen for easier studying. The platform includes a clean UI, animations, mobile-responsive design, and light/dark mode. User choices are saved using localStorage, and an affordable subscription system is included (₹49 monthly or ₹199 annually). The project runs fully on the client side with no backend required and can be easily deployed on Vercel using the “Other” framework preset. Built by Team Quantum Crew to make learning simpler and more accessible.
